# You.com api

Experimenting with the you.com api

## Overview

Execution:
% python first.py

This will hit the 'search' and 'rag' endpoints of you.com

The 'rag' endpoint is closer to what the frontend you.com results produce.  The snippets coming back are the chunks that the you.com
backend has already done for their own RAG infrastructure.

The 'search' endpoint is more pure search ( external LLM? )

## Output
